      `DeviceMethodResponse` provides functionality that allows
                       a device method implementation to construct and send a
                       response back to the service for a device method call. An
                       instance of this class is passed as the second parameter
                       to the callback registered via the
                       {@link module:azure-iot-device.Client#onDeviceMethod} method.
